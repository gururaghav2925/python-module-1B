# Heading
Python Program to Read One Integer and One Float Value and Print the Values

# Aim
To write a Python program that reads an integer and a float value from the user and prints them.

# Procedure
1. Use the `input()` function to read an integer value and a float value from the user.
2. Convert the input to the appropriate data types (`int` for the integer and `float` for the float).
3. Use the `print()` function to display the entered values.
# Program
```python
n1=int(input())
n2=float(input())
print(n1)
print(n2)
```

# Output
